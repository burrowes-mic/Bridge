<h1>BRIDGE</h1><br/><br/>
This project was developed by Michael Burrowes from May 2015 to May 2016 as a research project at Lexington Christian Academy.
<br/><br/>
While functional, the project is not very portable, and may not be able to run on operating systems other than Windows. Pictures/video will be provided in the future to exhibit functionality.
<br/><br/>
Source code is present in the /Qt/Bridge directory (GUI) and the /Bridge/PureData/Patches directory (Synthesis)
